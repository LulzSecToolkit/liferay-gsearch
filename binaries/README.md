# Installation Instructions

First, download the application binaries for your portal version. You can find detailed compatibility information in each distribution folder.

Then, if you choose to use the custom Elasticsearch adapter (recommended), find the binaries and instructions by your portal version in subfolder "custom-elasticsearch-adapter". 

If there's no custom adapter for your portal version not  available, please leave a ticket.
